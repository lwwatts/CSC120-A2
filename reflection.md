What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

One of the things I struggled with while working on this assignment was knowing what functions I did and 
didn't need. I included every function that was present in the procedural version of the resale shop file,
but I also had a couple extra. For example, I included a function to print out the Computer in a nice format,
so that I could better check to make sure my code was doing what I wanted. I found that very helpful, and I 
highly recommend it. However, I didn't realize I needed it at first because the procedural version uses 
dictionaries, not objects, to represent computers. I additionally added a function to the Computer class that 
just returned the year the computer was made. I know that you can directly access a class's global variables
from any file that accesses that class, but I felt like it was perhaps better practice to use a separate
function. To someone taking this course in the future, I recommend planning out exactly what functions you'll
put in each class so that you know you've covered all your bases.
